## Password Creation.
With advancing technology, the importance of a strong password is becoming more and more prevelant.
Who has time to create thousands of unique passwords over and over again anymore?

This tool will allow you to hit a button, enter your required criteria, and sit back as a unique password is created for you!

### Instructions for use
Simply respond yes or no to the displayed promts as they ask what you need in your password, select your required length, and receive your brand new password!
If you make a mistake, fret no longer as the application will inform you if something has gone wrong!

"Oh No", you say, "I've entered the wrong requirements! Now my password will not work!"
Fret no longer, as you can simply hit the button again, enter the correct values, and recieve your new (accurate) password!


## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```

### Message from me.
Don't poke around too much, the application is shy and will probably break.
If this happens use encouraging words, and reload the program. <br>
As the criteria is checked after being generated, there is a real possibility that the correct parameters are never reached, and may loop infinitely.
It is a very small probabiliy, but Murphy's Law and all that.

### Under Construction:
Criteria Checking is currently under construction, please try again later.
